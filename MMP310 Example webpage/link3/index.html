    <p> We can have folders inside of folders, or "directories" inside of directories. But how would we use the "top" level CSS file? Using "../" we can link to something a directory above us. This also lets us navigate to HTML files, as well. Look at how the following a href code links to "../index.html" instead of just "index.html".</p>
    <a href="../index.html">Link To Go Back</a> <p>
  </body>
